## Commit Message Guidelines

This project follows the **Conventional Commits** specification to ensure consistency, automation, and clarity in the commit history.

---

## Format

Use the following structure:

```
type(scope): short description
```

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add login API
fix(payment): handle null pointer in refund flow
refactor(user): simplify validation logic
docs(api): update authentication guide
```

---

## Commit Types

Use one of the following commit types:

* **feat** – Adds a new feature
* **fix** – Fixes a bug
* **refactor** – Code changes that do not alter behavior
* **docs** – Documentation updates
* **chore** – Maintenance or non-functional changes
* **style** – Formatting, linting, or styling
* **test** – Adds or updates tests
* **perf** – Performance improvements
* **ci** – CI/CD configuration changes
* **build** – Build system or dependency updates

---

## Scope

The scope should describe the module, domain, or component affected.

Examples:

```
auth
payment
user
api
dashboard
```

Example:

```
fix(payment): incorrect total calculation
```

If the change affects multiple areas, omit the scope:

```
chore: update dependencies
```

---

## Description

The description should:

* Be short and concise.
* Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update", not "added", "fixed").
* Focus on the main impact of the change.
* Avoid unnecessary details.

Good examples:

```
feat(user): add profile picture upload
fix(api): handle null response
```

Avoid:

```
update stuff
fix bugs
misc changes
```

---

## Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after the type or scope:

```
feat(auth)!: remove legacy login
```

Or include a detailed explanation in the commit body:

```
feat(auth): remove legacy login

BREAKING CHANGE: old login API is no longer supported.
```

---

## Commit Body (Optional)

Use the body to explain **why** the change was made, not **what**.

Example:

```
fix(payment): prevent duplicate transactions

The system did not validate transaction IDs properly.
This change ensures idempotency for payment requests.
```

---

## Best Practices

* Keep commits small and focused.
* Split unrelated changes into separate commits.
* Commit frequently.
* Ensure each commit represents a logical unit of work.
* Review commit history as part of code review.

---

## Automation Benefits

Following this format enables:

* Automated versioning
* Automatic changelog generation
* Release automation
* CI/CD integration
* Better auditability and traceability

---

feat(auth): add social login
fix(api): handle null response
